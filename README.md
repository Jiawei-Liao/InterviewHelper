# InterviewHelper
I suck at answering behavioural questions in interviews or online assessments. So I created this to help me practice. Currently work in progress.

# Planned Features
- Generate random question
- Record yourself
- Allow you to play it back
- Translate recording to text to feed to OpenAI GPT API to get feedback, as well as marking on criteria
- Feedback form connected to some database (for issues or question suggestions)
- Interview demo, asking several questions in a row
