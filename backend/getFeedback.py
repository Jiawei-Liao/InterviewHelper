test_transcription = r"In my previous job, I was reporting to two different managers. On one occasion, I was already working on a project for one manager and I received an additional project from the other manager simultaneously. However, I didnâ€™t inform either of them about it. Halfway through the projects, I realised I couldn't meet both deadlines. I told my managers what had happened, and we were able to find extra resources to complete the projects on time. Now, when I take on multiple projects, I keep my managers informed, map out my schedule and assess what I can handle more sensibly."
test_response = r"This response demonstrates a good reflection on a mistake made by the candidate and highlights the steps taken to rectify it. The candidate showed accountability by admitting their oversight and taking swift action to address the issue by involving their managers to find a solution. Additionally, the candidate shared a proactive approach taken after the incident to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future by better managing their workload and communicating effectively with their managers.\n\nTo enhance this response further, the candidate could provide more specific details about the impact of the mistake on the projects or the overall work environment. It would be beneficial to include specific examples of how they assessed their workload, communicated with their managers, and organized their tasks to handle multiple projects more effectively. Additionally, the response could be improved by elaborating on the lessons learned from this experience and how they have applied those lessons in subsequent situations to demonstrate growth and development.\n\nOverall, this response is a good starting point but could be strengthened by providing more detailed examples and showcasing personal growth and learning from the mistake."
